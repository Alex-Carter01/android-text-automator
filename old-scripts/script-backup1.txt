(Alice, Carly) Hey girl, guess what?! You'll never believe who I saw out with Bob last night 😱🙊

(Carly, Alice) OMG spill the tea, girl! Who was it?

(Alice, Carly) It was Karen, you know, Bob's ex-girlfriend! I can't even! They were being all lovey-dovey, holding hands and everything! 😮💔

(Carly, Alice) No way! But I thought he was over her? 🤔

(Alice, Carly) That's what I thought, too! I mean, they broke up, like, forever ago. Do you think he's cheating on me? 😢💔

(Carly, Alice) Oh, girl, I don't know. But you should confront him. You deserve better than that! 💪🚫

(Alice, Bob) Hey babe, we need to talk...

(Bob, Alice) What's up, babe? Everything okay? 😕

(Alice, Bob) No, everything's not okay. I saw you with Karen last night. What's going on, Bob? Do you still have feelings for her? 💔😡

(Bob, Alice) Wait, Alice. It's not what you think. Karen and I ran into each other by chance. We just caught up and nothing more. I swear! 😰🙏

(Alice, Bob) Really, Bob? I want to believe you, but it looked pretty cozy between you two. 😒💔

(Bob, Alice) Alice, please don't let this ruin what we have. She's just an old friend. I only have eyes for you, babe. 😍❤️

(Alice, Bob) I don't know, Bob. This is all so messed up. I need time to think. 😔

(Alice, Carly) Girl, did you talk to Bob? What did he say? 🤔

(Carly, Alice) He claims it was all innocent, just catching up. But I don't know, Carly. I'm so confused! 😩💔

(Alice, Carly) I don't blame you, girl. It sounds fishy to me. Maybe you need a break from him. Show him what he's missing! 💅🔥

(Alice, Bob) Look, Alice, I can't stop thinking about you. I messed up, but I love you. Can we work this out? 💔💔😢

(Bob, Alice) I want to believe you, Bob, but my trust is shattered. I need space. We're on a break! 😭💔

(Alice, Carly) Good for you, girl! Take some time for yourself. You deserve better than his shady behavior. 👏👏

(Carly, Alice) So, have you been single for long? Any hotties catching your eye? 😉🔥

(Alice, Carly) Funny you ask! I bumped into Jake at the supermarket yesterday. He's looking fine as hell, Carly! 👀😍

(Carly, Alice) Ooh, Jake, huh? He's always had a thing for you. Maybe it's time to explore that? 😏🚀

(Alice, Bob) Alice, I can't stand being without you. Those weeks apart have made me realize how much I need you. Can we please talk? 💔😭❤️

(Alice, Bob) Okay, Bob. Let's talk. But no more secrets, and full transparency! We need to rebuild the trust. 💔💪

(Alice, Carly) So, are you back with Bob? What happened? 😕💔

(Carly, Alice) Yes, Carly, we talked it out. He promised to be honest from now on. I'm giving him another chance. Fingers crossed! 🤞❤️

(Alice, Bob) I'm really sorry, Alice. I know it won't be easy, but I'm committed to making things right. I love you, always. ❤️😢

(Alice, Bob) I love you too, Bob. Let's take it one day at a time. We'll get through this together. 💔❤️🤝
