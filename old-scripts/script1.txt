['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carly']
(Alice, Carly) Hey Carly! You won't believe the drama that just went down! 😮

(Carly, Alice) OMG spill it, girl! What happened?

(Alice, Carly) So, remember how I introduced you to Bob last week? Well, turns out he's been flirting with me behind your back! 😱

(Carly, Alice) No way!! I thought he was into me! 😡

(Alice, Carly) I know, right? He's such a player! But get this... he just messaged me saying he wants to break up with you and date me instead! 😬

(Carly, Alice) 😡😡 That jerk! I can't believe he would do this to me! 😭

(Alice, Carly) You deserve so much better, Carly. Don't let him get away with this!

(Carly, Alice) 😭 I'm so heartbroken right now. I thought he was different. I trusted him.

(Alice, Carly) I know, it's tough, but remember, you're strong and amazing. You'll find someone who truly appreciates you. 💪❤️

(Carly, Alice) Thanks, Alice. You're a real friend. I appreciate your support. ❤️

(Alice, Bob) Bob, we need to talk. Carly just found out about us. 😱

(Bob, Alice) Oh no, I didn't expect her to find out so soon! What should we do?

(Alice, Bob) We have to come clean, Bob. It's the right thing to do.

(Bob, Alice) Fine, but I'm scared of the consequences. I don't want to lose you.

(Alice, Bob) If we truly care about each other, we'll find a way to make this work. 💑

(Alice, Carly) Carly, I have something important to tell you. 🙊

(Carly, Alice) What is it, Alice?

(Alice, Carly) Bob and I have been seeing each other. I'm so sorry 😔

(Carly, Alice) How could you do this to me, Alice? I trusted both of you! 😭

(Alice, Carly) I know it's not an excuse, but our feelings for each other just got out of hand. We never meant to hurt you.

(Carly, Alice) I can't believe this is happening. I thought we were friends!

(Alice, Carly) We were, Carly, and we still can be. Let's not let this destroy our friendship. 💔

(Carly, Alice) I don't know if I can trust you again, Alice. This betrayal hurts so much.

(Alice, Carly) I understand, Carly. Take all the time you need to heal. I'll be here for you, no matter what.

(Alice, Bob) Bob, Carly is devastated. She may not want anything to do with us anymore.

(Bob, Alice) It's my fault, I should've been honest from the start.

(Alice, Bob) We'll have to give her space to process everything. Hopefully, with time, she'll be able to forgive us.

(Alice, Carly) Just wanted to let you know that I miss you, Carly. I hope we can mend our friendship someday. ❤️

(Carly, Alice) I miss you too, Alice. It's going to take time, but maybe we can work things out. ❤️

(Alice, Bob) Bob, I've been thinking. Maybe we were both caught up in the excitement and made a mistake.

(Bob, Alice) Are you saying you want to break up?

(Alice, Bob) No, I'm saying let's take a break. We need to figure out who we are and what we want before we can be in a healthy relationship.

(Bob, Alice) You're right, Alice. Maybe we rushed into things too quickly. Taking a break sounds like the right move.

(Alice, Bob) And who knows, maybe we'll find our way back to each other when the time is right. 💔

(Alice, Carly) Carly, I broke up with Bob. It wasn't right for either of us. I hope we can rebuild our friendship. 😔❤️

(Carly, Alice) Alice, I appreciate your honesty. Maybe we can start fresh and put all this behind us. Let's go out for coffee tomorrow? ☕️

(Alice, Carly) That sounds perfect, Carly. Can't wait to catch up and move forward together. ❤️
