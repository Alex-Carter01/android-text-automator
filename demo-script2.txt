Character B: No, what h😬appened?
Character A: They broke up!
Character B: Seriously? They seemed so happy together.
Character A: Apparently, Mark cheated on her with Lisa from work.
Character B: No way! That's insane. I thought Lisa was married!
Character A: Yeah, turns out she's got some secrets. 😬
Character B: Drama! Any idea how Sarah found out?
Character A: Someone sent her screenshots of Mark and Lisa's texts.
Character B: Wow, people are ruthless.
Character A: And that's not all... Sarah's pregnant! 🤰
Character B: OMG, this just keeps getting crazier. How's Mark reacting to that?
Character A: He's denying it's his. 🙄
Character B: Classic move. 😒
Character A: But the twist is, Lisa's pregnant too, and she's keeping it! 🍼👶
Character B: This is like a soap opera. So, Mark's a potential baby daddy twice over?
Character A: Yep! 🤯
Character B: I can't even. This is too much. What's Sarah gonna do?
Character A: She's moving back in with her parents and lawyering up. 💼🏡
Character B: Good for her! I hope she gets everything she deserves. 👏
Character A: Right? This whole situation is a mess.
Character B: I can't even imagine. Thanks for spilling the tea, though! ☕
Character A: Anytime! Gotta keep you in the loop. 😄🍵📬
