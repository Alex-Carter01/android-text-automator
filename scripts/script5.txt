Alice
['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carly']
(Alice, Carly) OMG Carly, guess what! I just found out that Bob cheated on me!
(Carly, Alice) No way! Are you serious? 😱 How did you find out?
(Alice, Carly) I saw some texts on his phone. He's been texting this girl, Rebecca, behind my back! 🤬
(Carly, Alice) That's horrible, Alice! You deserve so much better. What are you going to do?
(Alice, Carly) I don't know, Carly. I feel so betrayed. I want to confront him, but I'm afraid of what he might say. 😔
(Carly, Alice) You should definitely confront him, Alice. You deserve an explanation!
(Alice, Carly) You're right, Carly. I need closure. I'll text him right now.
(Alice, Bob) Bob, we need to talk!
(Bob, Alice) Hey babe, what's up? Is something wrong?
(Alice, Bob) Don't you dare play dumb, Bob! I know about Rebecca. How could you cheat on me?!
(Bob, Alice) Alice, I swear it's not what you think! Rebecca is just a friend, I promise!
(Alice, Bob) Spare me the lies, Bob! I saw the messages. You've been flirting with her! 😡
(Bob, Alice) Please, Alice. I love you. I made a mistake, but it meant nothing. I want to be with you!
(Alice, Carly) Carly, he's confessing! I don't know if I can believe him. 🤔
(Carly, Alice) It's your call, Alice. You know him better than anyone. Trust your gut.
(Alice, Bob) Fine, Bob. One more chance. But if you mess up again, we're done!
(Bob, Alice) Thank you, Alice. I promise I'll do everything to make it up to you. I love you so much! 😘
(Alice, Carly) Carly, am I crazy for giving him another chance? 😕
(Carly, Alice) No, Alice. Love makes us do crazy things. I just hope he learned his lesson.
(Alice, Carly) Me too. I really hope he realizes how lucky he is to have me!
(Alice, Bob) Alice, I've been thinking about everything and I need to be honest with you. There's something else.
(Bob, Alice) What now, Bob? I can't handle any more surprises!
(Alice, Bob) I've been seeing Rebecca behind your back for months. I'm in love with her. I'm so sorry!
(Alice, Carly) Carly, I can't believe what I'm hearing. I can't breathe. 😭
(Carly, Alice) Oh my god, Alice! I'm so sorry. That's so messed up. You deserve so much better.
(Alice, Carly) I thought he had changed, Carly. I thought we had a chance. What am I going to do now?
(Carly, Alice) Right now, take some time for yourself, Alice. Surround yourself with people who love you. You'll get through this.
(Alice, Carly) I don't know how, Carly. I feel so broken. 😔
(Carly, Alice) I promise, Alice, you will heal. Time truly is the greatest healer.
(Alice, Carly) Thank you, Carly. I don't know what I'd do without you. ❤️
(Carly, Alice) You don't have to thank me, Alice. That's what friends are for. I'm here for you no matter what. 😘
