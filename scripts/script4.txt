Alice
['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carly']
(Alice, Carly) Hey girl! What’s the tea?
(Carly, Alice) Omg, Alice! You won’t believe what I just found out. Remember Bob? The guy you’ve been seeing?
(Alice, Carly) Yeah, what about him?
(Carly, Alice) Turns out Bob has been secretly dating someone else this entire time!
(Alice, Carly) 😱 No way! Are you serious?
(Carly, Alice) Dead serious. I saw him holding hands with another girl last night at the movies.
(Alice, Carly) This is unbelievable! How could he do this to me?
(Carly, Alice) I have no clue, girl. But I thought you deserved to know the truth.
(Alice, Bob) Hey babe, what’s up?
(Alice, Bob) Carly just told me something shocking. Are you cheating on me?
(Bob, Alice) What? Absolutely not! Carly must be spreading lies.
(Alice, Bob) I can't believe this. Carly and I have been friends for years. Why would she lie about something like this?
(Bob, Alice) Trust me, I love you and only you.
(Alice, Carly) Bob just denied everything. He says you're spreading lies, Carly.
(Carly, Alice) What? No way! I saw it with my own eyes. He can deny it all he wants, but the truth is out there.
(Alice, Carly) I don't know who to believe right now.
(Carly, Alice) Alice, I promise I'm telling you the truth. You deserve better than a cheater like Bob.
(Alice, Carly) Ugh, my heart is torn. I thought Bob was different.
(Bob, Alice) Baby, please believe me. You have to trust that Carly is trying to tear us apart.
(Alice, Bob) I don't know, Bob. This is all too much for me to handle.
(Carly, Alice) Look what I found on Bob's Instagram. He posted a picture with that other girl, kissing!
(Alice, Carly) Oh my god! I can't believe my own eyes! He really is cheating on me.
(Bob, Alice) Alice, that picture isn't real! It's some sick joke someone's playing on us.
(Alice, Carly) Bob, seriously? Who would do something horrible like that?
(Carly, Alice) Alice, just look at the picture, it's pretty convincing.
(Alice, Bob) I swear, Alice, it's not true. Please give me a chance to explain.
(Bob, Alice) Alice, please hear me out. It's not what you think.
(Alice, Bob) I don't know if I can trust you anymore, Bob. This has been a nightmare.
(Carly, Alice) Honestly, Alice, it's time to move on. You deserve someone who will treat you better.
(Alice, Bob) Carly, I trusted you and you betrayed me!
(Carly, Alice) Alice, I swear I didn't do this to hurt you. I just wanted to protect you from a cheater.
(Alice, Carly) I need some time to think. I can't believe everything has turned out like this.
(Bob, Alice) Alice, please don’t leave. I love you more than anything.
(Alice, Bob) I need time alone, Bob. I don't know if we can ever fix this.
(Alice, Carly) Thank you for telling me the truth, Carly. I don't know where my life is headed right now.
(Carly, Alice) I'm here for you no matter what, Alice. Take all the time you need.
(Alice, Bob) 🙁💔
