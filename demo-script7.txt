(Carly, Alice) No way! That scumbag! Imma confront his sorry ass 🤬💣

(Bob, Alice) Wait, what are you talking about? Who told you that crap? 😮🤔

(Alice, Bob) Jenny just told me herself! She said you two were getting cozy yesterday! How could you do this to me? 😭😡

(Bob, Alice) Alice, I swear it's a misunderstanding! Jenny is just jealous and making things up! 😢😰

(Bob, Alice) Remember when you went on that business trip last month, Alice? I found out Jenny was stalking you, and she convinced someone to impersonate me and frame us! 😱🔍

(Alice, Carly) What?! Are you serious? Jenny is a psycho! How could she go to such lengths? 😮😧

(Alice, Carly) Bob, I can't believe I doubted you. I'm so sorry! Let's work through this together. I love you too! ❤️💑

(Bob, Alice) It's alright, Alice. We'll get through this. But first, let's expose Jenny for the manipulative liar she is! 😈🔥

(Carly, Bob) You messed with the wrong couple, Jenny! Your reign of deception ends now! 🎭💔
