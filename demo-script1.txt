Character A: Hey, did you hear about Sarah and Mark?

Character B: No, what happened?

Character A: They broke up!

Character B: Seriously? They seemed so happy together.

Character A: Apparently, Mark cheated on her with Lisa from work.

Character B: No way! That's insane. I thought Lisa was married!

Character A: Yeah, turns out she's got some secrets.

Character B: Drama! Any idea how Sarah found out?

Character A: Someone sent her screenshots of Mark and Lisa's texts.

Character B: Wow, people are ruthless.

Character A: And that's not all... Sarah's pregnant!

Character B: OMG, this just keeps getting crazier. How's Mark reacting to that?

Character A: He's denying it's his.

Character B: Classic move.

Character A: But the twist is, Lisa's pregnant too, and she's keeping it!

Character B: This is like a soap opera. So, Mark's a potential baby daddy twice over?

Character A: Yep!

Character B: I can't even. This is too much. What's Sarah gonna do?

Character A: She's moving back in with her parents and lawyering up.

Character B: Good for her! I hope she gets everything she deserves.

Character A: Right? This whole situation is a mess.

Character B: I can't even imagine. Thanks for spilling the tea, though!

Character A: Anytime! Gotta keep you in the loop.
