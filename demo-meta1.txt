[Alice, Bob, Carly]
(Alice, Bob) Hey Bob! Did you hear the latest gossip? 🙊
(Bob, Alice) Hey Alice! No, spill the tea! ☕️
(Alice, Bob) Well, apparently Carly has been secretly dating someone behind her boyfriend's back! 😱
(Bob, Alice) What! Who is she dating? And who's her boyfriend? 🤔
(Alice, Bob) She's dating Mark, you know, from our math class. And her boyfriend is Josh! 😮
(Bob, Alice) Oh my gosh, that's insane! How did you find out? 🙀
(Alice, Bob) Laura caught them making out at the party last night and spilled it to everyone! 💋👀
(Bob, Alice) No way! Poor Josh, he has no idea. Should we tell him? 😥
(Alice, Bob) I don't know, but it's eating me alive. We have to do something, right? 😫
(Bob, Alice) Yeah, you're right. Let's confront Carly and see what she has to say for herself. 🤨
(Carly, Alice) Hey Alice, what's up? Did you hear something? 😳
(Alice, Carly) Carly, you've got some explaining to do! Laura saw you kissing Mark last night. What's going on? 😡
(Carly, Alice) Oh no, I'm so sorry! It's just, things haven't been great with Josh and I. I didn't mean for it to happen. 😭
(Alice, Carly) Well, you better talk to Josh and come clean. He deserves to know the truth. 🙅‍♀️
(Carly, Alice) You're right. I'll talk to him today. Thanks for being honest with me, Alice. 💔
(Alice, Carly) Just make sure to handle it properly, Carly. Honesty is always the best policy. Good luck! 🤞
(Carly, Josh) Hey, we need to talk. Meet me at our usual spot, okay? 😬
(Josh, Carly) Okay, babe. Is everything alright? 😦
(Carly, Josh) No, it's not. I've been seeing someone else behind your back, Josh. I'm so sorry. 😢
(Josh, Carly) What? Who is it? And why would you do this to us? 😭
(Carly, Josh) His name is Mark, and it just happened. We've been having problems, but that doesn't excuse my actions. I still love you, Josh. 💔
(Josh, Carly) I can't believe this. We've been together for three years, and you throw it away like it's nothing. I don't know if I can forgive you. 😔
(Carly, Josh) I understand, Josh. I'll give you the space you need, but please know that I'm truly sorry. 💔
(Josh, Carly) I need time to think. Don't contact me for a while, Carly. This hurts... a lot. 😢🚫
(Alice, Carly) What happened, Carly? Did you talk to Josh? 😥
(Carly, Alice) Yeah, I did. It didn't go well. Josh needs space. I've messed everything up. 😭
(Alice, Carly) I'm so sorry, Carly. Sometimes, we make mistakes and have to learn from them. Just give Josh the time he needs. 💔
(Carly, Alice) You're right, Alice. I hope he can forgive me one day. Thanks for being there for me. ❤️
(Alice, Carly) Of course, Carly. Friends support each other no matter what. You'll get through this. Stay strong! 🤗
