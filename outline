validate script
create character contacts (or rotatee thru set list)
open chat with character1
go through script
add logic for character3 (popup and change to contact them)
#add auto recording / editing
capsloc
#group chats?



gotta barebones demo of my youtube short generator 

script was all gpt3, android input all automated

next features i want to add: 
-automate the dialogue scripting part. I prompted chatgpt manually, so want it to be an api call and validate/format it to a script it can use
-automate the video recording/editing
    -want an over the top soundtrack with gasps and stuff, subway surfer gameplay, near-arab-funny level popup effects, anything to capture the addled mind of this generation
-automate video uploadinig
-long term might try with an android version not from the stone-age, but this is faster to iterate with

    Nice I like it
    Can you maybe make the phone taller so I can see more of the conversation
    & is it possible to give Debby a different #
    Do you make it auto type on keyboard
    Can you maybe make the phone taller so I can see more of the conversation

Alex Carter:
    definitely agree on this. i dont know android particularly. as a user is there a way to do that easily? i am currently thinking then at the same time i go to a newer android version, id try to configure a custom hardware profile with an extra long screen and crop out some of the top and bottom

RustyB AndroidVoiceText:
    Android software should adapt to whatever the hardware is
    So if you do a custom hardware profile youre good

    yeah thats ez, thats just what i put as a test. u reminded me that another upgrade i want is dialogues with more than 2 ppl, so like you see a notification pop up, and then u change chats to talk to osomeone else
and then the next next step would be switching apps to like snapchat, but wanna start w simipl stuff
